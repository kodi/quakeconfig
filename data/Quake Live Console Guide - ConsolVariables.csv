Description from the changelog:
Added cvar to disable idle sleep, to prevent FPS issues that may be caused by low resolution timers in Windows XP or on-demand CPU scaling. Setting com_idleSleep to 0 will restore the previous behavior of using up an entire CPU to wait until the next frame. Unless disabling com_idleSleep has a direct effect, it is highly recommended that com_idleSleep is kept ON.
Recommendation:
If you are having trouble reaching your desired framerate, you might try com_IdleSleep 0. I personally get 200 fps if I set maxfps 250 with com_idleSleep 1, I have to change it to 0 to get the full 250.",
